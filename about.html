  <p>The <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/">GNU Bourne Again SHell</a> is the default <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell">shell</a> on Linux and Apple MacOS X.

  <p>While you may not find the most detailed of explanations here, you can always check the <code>man</code> pages of your shell or the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html">bash reference manual</a> online for further information.</p>
